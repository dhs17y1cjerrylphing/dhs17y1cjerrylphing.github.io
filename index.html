<h2>Interest</h2>
<p>My hobbies are programming robots, running and playing badminton. I like to program robots as I get to explore the unlimited possibilities I can get from programming robots. I like to play <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badminton>badminton </a> and run as I can train my body as I play.
