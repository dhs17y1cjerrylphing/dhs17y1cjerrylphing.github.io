<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Review</span></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The strange thing about this movie is that it is more of a war drama than the sci-fi adventure one might expect from a Star Wars story. It is dark, it is gritty and the main characters are traumatized and made homeless by a brutal civil war waged by an oppressive Empire. Consequently, the main characters don't start out as heroes but turn into heroes by the choices they make. It is in many ways the most realistic description ever shown in a Star Wars movie of how ordinary people become warriors because there isn't much of an alternative but fight. "The time to fight is NOW!" and the actors do a great job of conveying that feeling to the audience. Sprinkled in is a fair bit of humor and comedic relief. We get good creature designs, ample special effects and a lot of fighting: Ground battle, urban combat, space engages, close quarter fighting; you name it, they give it to us. And don't think those fights are Disney squeaky clean. To a degree you get war in all its nasty brutality. The final result is a good action movie set in the Star Wars universe. Somewhat lacking in the light saber and Force aspects a true fan might wish for but still well worth the money you spend on it.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>

<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conclusion</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rogue one&rsquo;s ending is different from its predecessors.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rogue One is the first Star Wars film to be set outside the Episodic Sagas. With that, there was a lot of pressure on it to perform and launch this new series of Star Wars films.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By far, this is the least kid friendly film. This was at it's core, a war film, something we have never really gotten in the Star Wars universe. With the war theme we got an overall darker tone than we are use to, and it really suited the story they were telling. We never have experienced the war side of Star Wars because the stories have always been focused on a force user rather than the events around them. Because there are no jedi, we got to see more of the Rebellion and the Empire and the battle that is taking place during the original trilogy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offsetting the darker tone of the film, I thought this was perhaps the funniest Star Wars film. There are so many one liners and comedic moments that brings a lighter tone to the darker moments. I think much of the comedic moments came from the droid character K2SO. For the most part, he was the comedic relief and because of that, you are drawn to his character and is a stand out</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While still on the cast and characters, I thought they were near perfect. Apart from K2SO, I thought Donnie Yen's character, Chirrut was a close second standout. I&rsquo;m looking forward to another film of the franchise, as confirmed Star Wars :The Last Jedi releases December 2017.</span></p>
